# DiseaseGame
Disease game remaster. 
My primary goal is to clean up and optimize the code in my main game project using the improved skills I've gained since before.

Disease is hardcore isometric ARPG that takes inspiration from the iconic Diablo series. In this adventure, you'll be tasked with facing a horde of zombies to find your family and cure your infected daughter.

Hunt enemies, gather their notes, and uncover the secrets of disease spread trough your village.

Improve your physical abilities by gaining experience, enabling you to fight with multiple enemies at once.
